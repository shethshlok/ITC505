                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

                <p>Exploring the heritage of the indigenous people in Australia fascinated me to an extent which
                    led me to travel north and learn the history of the indigenous people from Japan who are known as
                    Ainu. 'Ainu' means 'Humans' in the Japanese language. It was astonishing to know about their tattoo
                    culture
                    which has existed since more than centuries ago which is a distinct feature of their community
                    and culture. There were a lot of good qualities to be learnt from their culture which not only the
                    population of Japan can imbibe in them; but also the whole world. To gain all the information I
                    visited
                    Encyclopaedia Britannica and Stand.ie which increased my knowledge about the great legacy of the
                    Ainu community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ainu were the original habitants of Japan and are dated around 10,000 years old. They were the
                    residents of the
                    Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands which are the parts of Japan (the rural part of Japan).
                    Physically,
                    the Ainu stand out distinctly from the Japanese as a separate ethnic group because of their
                    appearance and
                    physical differences like tattoos on their bodies (Video, YouTube).The Ainu were hunters, fisherman,
                    farmers
                    and gatherers who lived in harmony with nature and practiced these for their living. After being
                    invaded by the
                    children of the sun, they were enslaved, killed and driven from their lands in Japan.

                </p>

                <h3>ANIMISM: THEIR RELIGION</h3>
                <p>
                    The religion the Ainu community practiced was commonly known as <i>Animism</i>. Animism as described
                    by the anthropologists
                    is 'a religious system organized around a belief that plants, animals, inanimate objects, or natural
                    phenomena have
                    a spiritual or supernatural element.' (Nelson 2017, 6, 14). Their most important ritual took several
                    years and it
                    involved capturing a bear cub that was raised as a member of the family over the years. Taking care
                    and treating
                    the bear well in life would ensure that after death its spirit would ensure the well-being of them.
                    This was a
                    distinct feature of their community (Park, 2018).

                <h3>Their Culture</h3>
                <p>
                    Tattooing, for some amazing reason, has been a practice since the immemorial ancient times for the
                    Ainu community.
                    It's part of humanity and may also be defined as common day practice for them. 'However, we've been
                    doing this
                    up to the present to adorn our bodies, to mark ourselves with our life stories, or to express a
                    belief or a part
                    of our creative souls.' (Minerva, 2017). Tattoos back then were not merely for body decoration, but
                    a
                    woman actually cannot marry if she's not yet tattooed which was a custom of the Ainu community.
                    Their
                    famous tattooing culture consisted of facial tattooing which was only practiced by women, which they
                    used to
                    believe that tattooing was generated from 'Ancestral Mother' who is the younger sister of God.
                    (Minerva, 2017)

                </p>
                <h3>Ainu and the Aborginals of Australia</h3>
                <p>
                    As an anthropology student it was heartbreaking to know about how both the tribes were subjected to
                    extreme
                    racism and harsh government laws in both their respective governments. The indigenous people of
                    Australia,
                    the Aboriginals were colonized and exploited in the year of 1788 whereas the indigenous people of
                    Japan,
                    the Ainu community were forbidden by the government from practicing their rituals and their lands
                    were
                    declared as public lands which resulted in them losing their identity, culture and heritage.

                </p>

                <p>
                    However there are a lot of similarities among both the tribes of the Aboriginals of Australia and
                    the
                    Ainu of Japan. The Aboriginals were not allowed to use their language after the colonization.
                    (Korff, 2020).
                    Whereas on the other hand, the Ainu people were restricted to the access to their language in 1899.
                    Just like the Aboriginals were given harsh government laws, The assimilation by the Japanese
                    government
                    caused the Ainu to be considered as a dying ethnic group.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Although there are similarities, both the tribes stand out from each other with different
                    experiences
                    they had, because of the white supremacy in Australia, The Aboriginals were snatched from their
                    children also known as 'Stolen Generation'. In Japan, The Ainu people in 1899 were labelled as
                    'former aborigines' which can be classified as how the western influence has indulged in name-giving
                    rather than sticking by the names of what they are known as.

                </p>

                <h3>CULTURE OF ABORIGINALS</h3>
                <p>
                    They also had different cultures, The Torres strait Islanders of Australia had huge influence on
                    oceans,
                    islands and aquatic life whereas, the culture of Ainu people had an influence of blood sacrifice and
                    bear
                    rituals. Ainu people also believed a lot in after life. This shows how the old history and the
                    importance
                    of indigenous people's values that really influence me in today's competitive world. Their culture,
                    practices and tradition is something which can incite many solutions to the happening issues across
                    the globe
                    relating from healthcare to global peace.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The first historical or documented appearance of Ainu occurred in the twelfth century in the Yuan
                    Dynasty of China.
                    It concerned a record of the people living in the region of Sakhalin (Namikawa, 2004). The Ainu
                    people of Japan
                    frequently clashed with the Nivkh, an indegeneous group of Sakhalin. The Nivkh were subjected to
                    Yuan Dynasty rule.
                    Starting from 1308 till the 16th century, the rule of the Yuan Dynasty was under the Ainu people.
                    During this period
                    they were indulged in trade with the Pan-Japan Sea. Also, the trading remained active with the
                    Ryukyu (currently Okinawa),
                    Kamakura and Muromachi governments of Japan.
                </p>

                <h3>AINU PEOPLE IN THE EYES OF OTHER</h3>
                <p>
                    The Ainu people are also described as the image of the devil (Oni) by Suwa Daimyojin Ekotoba. In
                    1356. During this
                    time, Wajin also describes the Ainu group as the dominant ethnic group of Japan. He also inferred
                    that they were found
                    in the region of Matsumae and Hakodate (the southern part of Ezo or Ezo-chi, or what was eventually
                    called Hokkaido).
                    Around the early 15th century, the trade with the Wajin was more abusive and was under the control
                    of the Ando family.
                    Wajin's trade was exploiting the Ainu resources, It got all stable under the rule of the Matsumae
                    Han (clan).

                </p>

                <p>
                    The unfair practices in the trade continued until there were revolts seen from the Ainu people side
                    and then the government
                    took some steps to stop it, Like the government implemented stricter policies in order to control
                    the Ainu people in Ezo.
                    Despite the fact that the Ainu never formed a unity as a nation, the Japanese government considered
                    the Ainu to be a foreign group.
                    The government established Ezo-chi Bugyo (governing magistracy) and made efforts to assimilate and
                    Japanize the Ainu people,
                    thus putting forth the claim, 'Where the Ainu (Japanese) live' is Japan.' (Mitsuharu, 3-4)

                </p>

                <p>
                    The year 2008 was historic for the Ainu, since the Japanese government, for the first time in
                    history, recognized them as an
                    indigenous people of Japan. However, despite the government's promise to create a new law to help
                    the Ainu recover their status,
                    regain their culture, and rebuild relationships between Ainu and non-Ainu people in Japan, the
                    corresponding law has not yet
                    been created as of January 2012. The Japanese government has been reluctant to discuss injustices
                    attributable to laws, which
                    oppressed Ainu for the purpose of political gain. This tacit denial of responsibility continues to
                    hamper any forward progress
                    of policies that could begin true restoration of Ainu wellbeing.

                </p>

                <h3>MY PERSPECTIVE</h3>

                <p>
                    Sitting here in a developed country, we can't tell anything about the situation of the Ainu people
                    of Japan.
                    Their feelings of historic oppression exist since hundreds of years, the existing exploiting
                    policies and laws
                    imposed by the government. How now the Japanese government is promoting and implementing cultural
                    recovery.
                    Using methods to 'bring back' their traditional ways and lifestyle. There are any examples that show
                    us different
                    initiatives taken by different organizations from all over the world. One of the best one is of
                    Shimazaki of the
                    Hokkaido Ainu Association (2010), 'attests to the difficulty of combining people's voices and social
                    needs because
                    currently there are no mechanisms to collect data. These are significant areas where research, which
                    values and
                    respects the indigenous standpoint' (Mitsuharu, 12-13). This initiative provides an evidence of the
                    social justice
                    being served to the Ainu and their cultures being restored. The facts that were disclosed to me were
                    disturbing.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Ainu people's society is generally defined as Patriarchy, 'describes a society with a male-dominated
                    political and
                    authority structure and an ideology that privileges males over females in domestic and public
                    spheres.'
                    (Dr. Mukhopadhyay,Tami Blumenfield, Susan Harper, Ph.D, 2017, Perspectives: An Open Invitation to
                    Cultural Anthropology,
                    Chapter 4, Page 44.) by many anthropologists in today's world. Their ritual consisting of bears is
                    only performed by
                    the men of the family, and there is very little participation of the females of the family.

                </p>

                <h3>CONCLUSION
                </h3>

                <p>
                    After doing all the research about the Ainu people from Japan, I came across a lot of astonished
                    facts and information.
                    Taking a lot of reference from the Scholastic resource of Mitsuharu Vincent Okada which helped me a
                    lot. Getting to
                    know about the problems faced by the Ainu people and how they had to live under the pressure of the
                    Japanese Governement.
                    How different policies were implemented by the Japanese government. Examining their social
                    institution and understanding
                    their community.
